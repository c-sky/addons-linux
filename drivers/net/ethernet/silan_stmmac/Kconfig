            1) If the network interface is in napi scheduled state, we just do
        nothing as function "stmmac_poll" will call function "stmmac_tx" to finish
        the Tx completion work of the previous transmitted packet when a packet
        is received;
            2) If the network interface is NOT in napi scheduled state, then we
